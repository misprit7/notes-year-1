* Sealifies, Seals and Celebs: Expressions of Inuit Resistance in the Twitter Era
  * Rodgers and Scobie
  * "The #sealfie response, which quickly emerged as a farreaching campaign on its own terms, is a novel move to engage in methods that invoke and inspire emotional and moral reactions, as well as defend the right to practice traditions. In this recent campaign, they demonstrated the salience, continuity, and importance of seal hunting in their communities. In so doing they also highlight this as a cautionary tale for animal rights activists whose campaigns may pit the rights of animals against the rights of indigenous peoples, an insurmountable binary for animal rights groups."
