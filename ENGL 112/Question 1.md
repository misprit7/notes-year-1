* Question 1
  * Thesis
    * In what amounts to an attempt at critical agricultural studies, I will treat railway branch lines and grain elevators as unconventional media that not only illuminatethe politics of technological change in rural settings, but also shed light on the complex ways in which infrastructural technologies mediate the organization of social and political life more generally.
* Question 2
  * Grain elevators foster a sense of community
  * Not technological change is beneficial for everyone
  * Political activism can inspire real change and independance
