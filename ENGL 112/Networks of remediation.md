# Networks of remediation
* Premises
  * Media exist in relation to each other
  * Relationship has a social, material, and economic definition
    * e.g. Film borrowing social aspects from theater
    * e.g. Film borrowing material technology from lantern slides
    * e.g. Film borrowing the Vaudeville circuit economic system
      * Transportation of reels, etc.
* Communication media and change
  * Developing new contexts
  * Remediating many media
    * e.g. Twitter remediates the currentness of the newspaper, interactive connection of chat rooms and the remote connection from the telegraph (but no moderator)
* Material contexts
  * Skeuomorphs
    * Objects that mimic other objects in their design in order to convey a relationship of use, status or function
      * e.g. sleek appliances because of its association with status
* Technology and networks
  * No cause and effect
  * Interconnectedness and continuity
  * "The manufacture and utilization of equipment, tools, and machines, the manufactured and used things themselves, and the needs and end that they serve, all belong to what technology is." - Heidegger
  * People and tools networked together
* The medium is the message
  * Marshall McLuhan at UofT
  * The technological form of media affects how we use i and what we expect it to do
  * Some media ask us to interact with them more than others
* Technological determinism
  * The material form of technology shapes its social uses
  * The uses of technology are shaped by its designers
* What does *The Buzzer* remediate
  * Newspaper
  * Newsletter
  * Blog
  * Library
  * Poster
* Social construction of technology
  * The social context of technology (i.e. how people use it) shapes its function
  * Technology can have unforeseen application in the hands of users
  * Counterpoint to technological determinism
* Remediation
  * Social, economic and material contexts create media in a networked relationship rather than cause/effect
  * Media develop away from remediation of other media as they develop their own contexts
* Experiecne of media
  * Immediacy = absence of intermediary interpretation through media
  * Hypermediacy = overwhelming and obvious presence of media
  * The same media may be seen as hypermediate or immediate depending on the user
* Authenticity and remediation
  * New media as better media? 
  * Is pop culture as expressed through media authentic? ENlightened? Oppressed? 
  * Pop culture as a network of social, economic, and material contexts
