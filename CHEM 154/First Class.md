# Unit 2 - The periodic table and atomic structure
* Blueprint question
  * How can you predict engine part failure before it happens? 
* Learning objectives
  * After this unit you will be able to: 
    * Define, in words or using equations, effective nuclear charge, atomic radius, ionization energy, and electron affinity. 
    * Rank elements and ions according to their $Z_{\textnormal{eff}}$, atomic size, ionization energy, and electron affinity
    * Rationalize the relative ionization energies and electron affinities of atoms
* Periodic table
  * Colums in the periodic table are called groups
  * Rows in the periodic table are called periods
  * s-block: left
  * d-block: middle
  * p-block:right
  * f-block: bottom
  * Different names for most groups
* Bohr model of the atom
  * Proposed an atomic model in which electrons orbit around the nucleus in perfectly defined orbits
  * Atoms are neutral: electronic charge balanced by a positive charge, the nucleus
  * Atoms are stable: Coulomb forces must be balanced with something else, Bohr thought angular momentum
  * Atoms emit and absorb specific wavelengths of light: electrons move between discrete energy levels, first notion of quantization before Quantum Mechanics
  * The equation used to determine the maximum number of electrons in a particular orbit: #$e^- = 2n^2$ (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...)
* Multielectron species
  * Energies, and absorbance/emission wavelengths of one lectron species can be calculated using the bohor model. However, this odel is insufficient to deal with multielectron species
* Valence Electrons
  * The number of electrons in the sand p subshells of the occupied electronic shell with largest n for the neutral element
  * This shell is termed the valence shell
  * Valence electrons are responsible for the formation of bonds
  * non-valence electrons are called core electrons
* Worksheet
  * Unit 2 number 1
Valence electrons: A. 3 B. 1 C. 4
Number of core electrons: A. 2 B. 10 C. 2
Neutral element: A. Boron B. Sodium C. Carbon
