* Normal levels
  * Real GDP (i.e. potential)
  * Annual real GDP growth = 2%
  * Annual inflation rate = 2%
  * Unemployment rate = 6%
* AE Model
  * Aggregate expenditure model: a pacroeconomic model that focuses on the short-run relationship between total expenditure and real GDP, assuming that the price level is constant
  * Based on four central concepts: 
    * constant price level
    * demand-determined output
    * equilibrium national income
    * the (simple multiplier)
  * Equilibrium GDP = what GDP actually is
  * Potential GDP = what GDP should be
  * Desired aggregate expenditure
    * Aggregate desired expenditure (AE) is divided into the same categories as the national account: 
    * $AE=C+I+G+NX$
      * All of these are "desired" versions
    * Desired: what consumers/firms/government would like to purchase given certain prices and national income
  * Equilibrium: occurs when total expenditure on output is equal to the value of the output produced
    * Aggregate desired expenditure = Y = actual GDP
    * For simplicity, assume the economy is not growing
  * Two types of AE:
    * Autonomous expenditures ($\alpha$): do not depend on the level of national income (Y)
    * induced expenditures ($\beta$): do depend on the level of national income (Y)
  * $AE=C+I+G+NX=\alpha+\beta Y$
    * $C=a+b(1-t)Y$
    * $I=\delta$
    * $G=\Omega$
    * $NX=X-IM=\epsilon-mY$
    * $\alpha=A+\delta+\Omega+\epsilon$
      * $\Omega$ is fiscal policy
    * $\beta=b(1-t)+m$
  * $AE=\underbrace{\alpha=A+\delta+\Omega+\epsilon}_{\alpha}+(b(1-t)+m)Y$
