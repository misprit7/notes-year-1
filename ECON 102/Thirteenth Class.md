# Thirteenth Class
* Imports and exports
  * Exports are autonomous
  * Imports scale with GDP
  * $NX=X-IM=X-mY$
  * Shifts in next export function
    * Increase in foreign income $\to$ more foreign demand
    * Rise in Canadian Prices decreases $X$ and rotate's $IM$ down (i.e. $NX$ function shifts down and gets steeper
  * Appreciation of Canadian dollar (same as above)
* Changes in equilibrium and fiscal policy
  * Fiscal policy is the government affecting the economy by way of its spending habits
  * Often clear in which direction fiscal policy could be adjusted, but less clear how much is necessary (because of multiplier)
  * When $G>T$, budget deficits problems
* Demand determined output
  * The $AE$ model is based on these three central concepts: 
    * Demand-deternmined output
    * Equilibrium national income
    * The simple multiplier
    * Constant price level
  * Next modle, $AD$ and $AS$ model we will allow variable price level
    * More complicated but more realistic
