# Ninth Class
* Desired aggregate expenditure
  * Equilibrium: occurs when total expenditure on output is equal to the value of output produced
    * i.e. Aggregate desired expenditure $=Y=$ Actual GDP
* Desired consumption \($C$\) expenditure
  * Factors that affect the level of consumption
    * Current disposable income ($Y_d$)
    * Expected future income
    * Household wealth
    * The interest rate
    * The price level
  * $Y_D$ has a very strong positive relationship with $C$ holding other things constant
    * i.e. Slope of consumption vs disposable income is very linear
  * Consumption $= C=a+bY_D=a+b(1-t)Y$
    * National income ($Y$): GDP
    * Disposable income ($Y_D$): National income ($Y$) - Net Taxes
    * Net taxes ($T$): Taxes - Transfer payments
    * $t$: net tax rate
    * National income ($Y$) $=GDP=$ Disposable income ($Y_D$)+Net Taxes ($T$)
  * Two possible uses of disposable income: consumption ($C$) or saving ($S$)
  * Slope of consumption function $=$ marginal propensity to consume ($MPC$)
    * $b=MPC=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y_D}$
    * Note: $0<b<1$
  * Desired Saving ($S$)
    * By definition, disposable income not spent is saved
      * $Y=C+S+T$
    * $MPS+MPC=1$
  * Shifts in the consumption function
    * $\Delta$ wealth
      * When wealth increases, $C$ increases
    * $\Delta$ real interest rate
      * When real interest rates go down, $C$ increases
    * $\Delta$ expected future income
      * When people expect a higher future income, $C$ increases
    * Note: these all shift the consumption graph up or down, they don't change the slope ($MPC$). This shift is called $\Delta A$
