# Eleventh Class
* Changes in equilibrium national income
  * Two types of shifts: 
    * Shift parallelly
      * E.g. Multiplier
    * Rotate
      * E.g. Changes in slope terms
* The multiplier
  * Measure of the size of the change in equilibrium $Y$ that results from a change in $AE$
  * Small change in desired aggregate expendiutre ($AE$) causes a larger change in equilibrium real GDP
  * Multiplier $=\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta A}=\frac{1}{1-z}$
    * $z=$ slope of $AE$ function
  * In our simplest form of macro models, the multiplier $>1$
    * i.e. a small change in aggregate expenditure causes a larger change in equilibrium real GDP
