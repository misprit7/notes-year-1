* Overview
  * Will learn improtance of key macroeconomic vairalbes
    * Price level and inflation
    * Interest rates
    * unemployement
    * National income (output)
  * Will learn the meaning of long-run trends or short-run fluctuations, and that government policy is relevent to both
* Key macroeconomic variables
  * Inflation and the price level
    * Price level: the average level of all prices in the economy at a point in time
      * Two typical (but not perfect) ways to measure price lvel
    * Inflation: the rate at which the price level is changing over time
      * Price level$^{2014}=102.5$
      * Price level$^{2014}=105.2$
      * $\%\Delta x=\frac{x^{t+1}-x^t}{x^t}\cdot 100\%$
    * Two typical ways to measure price level
      * GDP deflator - based on the price of all output produced in the ocuntry
      * Consumer price index (CPI) - based on the price of basket of goods that typical households consume
      * Note: What Canadians buy is not the same as what Canadians produce, so GDP deflator isn't the same as CPI
  * Consumer Price Index
    * Statistics Canada surveys 16758 Canadian households on their spending habits
      * Many things not in the basket
        * e.g. Ferrari, Moncler jacket 
    * Caluculating  CPI
      * $CPI_T=\frac{\sum P_tQ_0}{\sum P_0Q_0}\cdot 100$
        * P is price, Q is quantity
      * The CPI at time T equals the ratio of the dollar amount necessary to buy the typical basket of goods at time T divided by the dollar amount necessary to buy the SAME typical basket of goods in the base year, multiplied by 100
