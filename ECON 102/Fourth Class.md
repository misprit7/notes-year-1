* Why inflation matters
  * Purchasing power of money is inversely related to the price level
* Interest rates
  * Nominal interest rate: the rate expressed in money terms
  * Real interest rate: the rate expressed in terms of purchasing power
  * Real interest rate $\approx$ Nominal interest rate - inflation
* Unemployemnt
  * Employment: the number of workers ($\geq$ 15) who hold jobs
  * Unemployment: the number who are not employed and are looking for a job
    * $\frac{\textrm{Unemployed}}{\textrm{Labour Force}}\cdot 100\%=\textrm{Unemployment rate}$
  * Labour force: the total number of employed+unemployed
    * $\frac{\textrm{Labour force}}{\textrm{Working - age population}}\cdot 100\%=\textrm{Participation rate}$
* Types of unemployment
  * Frictional unemployment
    * Short term unemployment that arises from the process of matching workers with jobs
  * Structural unemployement
    * Unemployment that arises from a permanent mismatch between skills of workers and jobs
  * Seasonal unemployment
    * Due to seasonal factors or fluctuations of demand due to time of year
  * Cyclical unemployment
    * Caused by business cycle recession
    * Not good
