# Tenth Class
* Desired Investement (I) expenditure
  * Most volativle component of GDP
  * Changes in investment expenditure are strongly associated with short-run fluctuations
  * If $Y<AE$, then inventory investment is negative
  * If $Y=AE$, inventory investment $=0$
  * Factors that affect the level of investment
    * Expectations of future profitability
    * Real interest rate
    * Profit
  * In this simple modle, $I$ does not change with $Y_D$ and $Y$
    * Note: changes can still happen, but these factors are not purely influenced by GDP and are thus autonomous
* Aggregate expenditure function
  * At equilibrium, $Y=AE$
    * i.e. Actual GDP ($Y$) = Desired aggregate expenditure ($AE$)
  * In AE modle, output is said to be demand-determined
  * Slope of AE: $z$ = marginal propoensity to spend = a $1$ increase in $Y$ would cause $AE$ to inrease by \$$X$
  * At equilibrium, no inventory investment
