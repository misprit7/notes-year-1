# Twenty-First Class

* Heat engines
  * Convert heat to work via cyclic process
  * Stirling cycle is this cyclic process
* Efficiency of an engine
  * $Q_H$: Heat absorbed by gas each cycle
  * $Q_C$: Heat expelled by gas
  * $W$: Net work done each cycle
    * Takes into account all parts
  * Efficiency is $e=\frac{W}{Q_H}$
  * Engine process (Otto cycle)
    * Step 1: Adiabatic compression
    * Step 2: Combustion of gasoline
    * Step 3: Adiabatic expansion
    * Step 4: Exhaust with constant volume
      * Technically goes to a much lower volume and back again, but since the net work done in this step is small, it can be modelled as constant volume
