* Gas simulation
  * Doubling average speed of quadruples pressure
    * Consistent with temperature, since doubling velocity also quadruples average kinetic energy
* Defining temperature using constant volume gas thermometer
  * Kelvin scale is defined by: $T=\textnormal{const.}\cdot P$
    * Constant depends on what gas is used
  * Pressure vs. Kelvin temperature for constant volume gas thermometers is proportional
  * To calibrate, $T = 273.16$k is used, the triple point of water
    * $T \propto P$, or $P = mT$
  * Pressure vs Celcius temperature for constant volume gas thermometers is linear
    * $P = mT + b$
  * To solve Proportionality equations:
    * $P = mT$
    * $P_1 = mT_1$ and $P_2 = mT_2$
    * $\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{T_1}{T_2}$, then plugin numbers
* Farenheit
  * $T_{\textnormal{farenheit}}=\frac{9}{5}T_{\textnormal{celcius}}+32$
* Thermal expansion
  * $\triangle L = \alpha L_0 \triangle T$
    * $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion
    * Assumges $\frac{\triangle L}{L_0}$
    * $\alpha$ can depend on $T$
