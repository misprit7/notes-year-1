# Thirty-Sixth Class
* Gravity according to Newton
  * $F_g=G\frac{Mm}{R^2}$
  * Doesn't explaing everything
    * e.g. Mercury's orbit isn't predicted by this law
* Weird fact: 
  * You can't tell the difference between free fall and situation with no forces
  * i.e. Why don't we feel gravity in space near the earth? 
* Einstein suggested there is no force of gravity
  * Problem: If no force of gravity, why don't objects near the earth jsut move in a straight line? 
  * Newton's 1st law: In the absence of forces, objects will move in a straight line with a constant velocity
  * Einstein: Curved space
* Gravity according to Einstein: General relativity
  * Matter + energy cause space to bend/warp
  * Effects of gravity explained by objects moving on natural paths in this curved space
  * Einstein's equation
    * $G_{\mu v}=8\pi G_N\cdot T_{\mu v}$
    * Describes dyamics of spacetime + interaction with matter
  * TL;DR: space is like a big rubber sheet
    * But in 3D "bending" into a 4th dimension, not 2D
* Actual rubber sheet: modeled by coupled oscillators
  * Can space itself oscillate and have waves? 
    * Einstein's equation says yes!
    * For small ripples, Einstein's equations gives the same math as waves in a solid
* How do we drive this oscillation? 
  * Oscillating matter system
* Can we observe these gravitational waves? 
  * LIGO experiment
    * Try to measure these changes in length directly using an interferometer
* Most gravitational waves are too small to measure
  * What is the strongest source? 
    * Black holes
* Black holes: largest starts have unbounded collapse at end of life
* Note: Shape of this wave pulse determined by Einstein's equations
  * Prediction: shape depends on black hole masses amount of rotation
* First detection
  * Excellent match to wave shape for $M_1=36M_{sun}$ and $M_2=29M_{sun}$
  * Change in length was $\frac{1}{1000}$ of a proton size 
  * Happened 1.4 billion years ago
