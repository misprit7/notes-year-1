# Twenty-Fifth Class
Nov 1, 2019
* Example problem: 1 mol of ideal monatomic gas is cooled at constant volume from $300$K to $200$K. What is the change in entropy? 
  * Const $V$: 
    * $W=0$
    * $Q=\Delta u$
    * $dQ=nC_VdT$
  * $dS=nC_V\frac{dT}{T}$
  * $\Delta S=nC_V\int_{i}^{f}\frac{dT}{T}=nC_V\ln(\frac{T_f}{T_i})$
* Heat: Area under curve on a $TS$ diagram
  * $dQ=TdS$
  * $S$ increasing $\to Q>0$
  * $S$ decreasing $\to Q<0$
* Net Heat/work for a cycle from $TS$ diagram
  * $Q_{net}=W_{net}=$ area inside cycle
  * Clockwise: $Q>0$
  * Counterclockwise: $Q<0$
* Efficienty on a $TS$ diagram
  * $W_{net}=$ area enclosed
  * $Q_{in}=$ area under $\Delta S>0$ parts
  * $e=\frac{W_{net}}{Q_{in}}$
* Carnot Cycle
  * Maximum possible efficiency for fixed maximumum and minimum temperatures $T_H$, $T_C$
  * Shaped like a rectangle on a $TS$ diagram
  * Efficiency of a carnot sycle is $\frac{T_H-T_C}{T_H}=1-\frac{T_C}{T_H}$
  * Composed of two isothermal processes and two adiabatic processes
  * Shaped much less normal on a $PV$ diagram
  * Not very useful since isothermal processes must be very slow
