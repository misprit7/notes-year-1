# First Class
## About the teacher
* Name: Mark Van Raamsdonk
* Research is in String theory, quantum gravity, black holes and cosmology
* "Not scary"
## What is this course about? 
* Interactive demo
  * What do you see? 
    * Brownish Styrofoam brick coming out of presumably liquid nitrogen
  * What is really happening here that's not immediatly apparent? 
    * Heat transfer from table to brick
  * His observations
    * Warming
    * Transfer of heat because its not in equilibrium
    * Emitting light/radiation because of its temperature
    * Balanced from gravity
    * Expanding due to heat contraction/expansion
    * More kinetic energy in brick molecules
    * Entropy of brick is increasing
    * Water condencing on the surface
    * Breaking of bonds? 
    * Neutrinos passing through the brick
    * Brick absorbing light/radiation from room
    * Applying gravity to everything
    * Pressure on water that has been condenced
    * Cooling its surroundings
    * Molecular collisions that results in heat transfer
  * Thermodynamics: how to summarize microscopic physics of $10^23+$ things
  * Oscillations + waves: collective motions of macroscopic collections of molecules (eg. sound, guitar strings, oceans)
    * Also more fundamental waves (eg. light, gravitational)
* Goal of Physics
  * Observe the universe
  * Understand the rules
    * We now understand the pricese mathematics that underlies physical phenomena from 100 trillion times smaller than we can see
  * Make predictions
* Course information
  * Webpage
  * Games night with professors 5:30-8:00
  * Location: ENgineering student centre Atrium
  * First office hours: Friday 3:30 - 4:30 Hennings 420 or before/after class
