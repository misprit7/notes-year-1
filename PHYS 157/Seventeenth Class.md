* $\Delta E_{gas}=Q-W$
* $W=F\cdot\Delta x_{||}$
  * Assumes constant force
  * $F$ is force exerted by system
  * $\Delta x_{||}$ is the displacement in direction of force
* $W=PA(-d)=P\cdot \Delta V$
  * When gas is compressed by an external force, the work done by the force is positive and the work done by the gas is negative.
* Work is the area under the $P$ vs $V$ graph
  * Tip: 1kPa$\cdot$1L=1Pa$\cdot$ 1m$^3$
  * Positive if $V$ is increasing
  * Negative if $V$ is decreasing
$$
  W=\int_{V_i}^{V_f}P(V)dV
$$
* $u$: the energy of a gas
  * Sum of: 
    * Kinetic energy
    * Rotational energy
    * Vibrational energy
    * Electrostatic potential energy
  * Main equation: $\Delta u=nC_V\Delta T$
    * $C_V$: molar specific heat
  * Larger fo more complex molecules
