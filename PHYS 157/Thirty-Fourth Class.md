#Thirty-Fourth Class

* Principle of superposition
  * When two or more waves overlap, the net displacement $D(x, t)$ is equal to the sum of the displacements we would have if each wave were present alone
  * Waves add without disturbing each other
* Application: standing waves
  * What if both are present on the same string? 
  * $D(x, t)=A\cos(kx-\omega t)+A\cos(kx+\omega t)$ $\leftarrow$ sum of left and right moving waves
  * $=A\cos(kx)\cos(\omega t)+A\sin(kx)\sin(\omega t)+A\cos(kx)\cos(\omega t)-A\sin(kx)\sin(\omega t)$
  * $D(x, t)=2A\cos(kx)\cos(\omega t)$
  * Nodes: displacement fixed at $0$
    * Where $\cos(kx)=0$
  * Antinodes: oscillated with maximum displacement
    * Where $\cos(kx)=\pm1$
* Example: guitar/violin string
  * Displacement must be zero at ends
  * Possible wavelengths
    * $\lambda=2$
    * $\lambda=1$
    * $\lambda=\frac{2}{3}$
    * $\lambda=\frac{1}{2}$
    * General answer: $\lambda=\frac{2}{n}, n\in\Z$
* Important: $v$ depends only on properties of our string, does not depend on $\lambda$, $f$
  * Depends on tension $T$
  * Depends on mass/length
  * Which combination of these has units of velocity?
  * $v=\sqrt\frac{T}{\mu}$
