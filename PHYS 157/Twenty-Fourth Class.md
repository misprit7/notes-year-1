* Entropy of a macroscopic confiugration: 
  * $S=const.\cdot\log{(N)}$
    * $N$ is the number of microscopic configurations of this type
* Second law of thermodynamics: 
  * Total entropy of a closed system never decreases
  * Probability of such a decrease is unimaginably small
* Entropy is additive (A.K.A. extensive)
  * $S_{total}=S_1+S_2$
  * Works because $\log(N_1\cdot N_2)=\log(N_1)+\log(N_2)$
* Entropy: macroscopic definition
  * $dS=\frac{dQ}{T}$
    * $Q$ is heat added
    * $dS$ is change in entropy
  * This definition can be proven from the microscopic definition of $S$
  * Parts of a system can decrease, but the overall entropy of the entire system should always increase
* Entropy is a state variable
  * Doesn't matter what the process is, in a full cycle on a $PV$ diagram, no change in entropy results in the system
  * However, $S$ for environment usually increases
