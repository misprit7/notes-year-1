* Glass drinking water experiment
  * Candle heats air inside cup
  * Candle goes out (consumes $O_2$)
  * Temperature decreases (no more candle burning)
  * Pressure is less than outside pressure "sucks" water up
* Work
  * Energy transferred by a mechanical process
  * e.g. If gas increases the potential energy of an object by 1J, then the gas did 1J of work
* First law of thermodynamics
  * Conservation of energy
  * $\Delta E_{gas}=Q-W$
    * $\Delta E_{gas}$ is the net change in energy of gas
    * $Q$ is heat added to gas$
    * $W$ is work done by the gas
    * $E_{gas}$ is often called $u$
* Work done by gas
  * $W=F\Delta x$
    * $F$ is the force exerted by gas
    * $\Delta x$ displacement in direction of force
    * This is always the work done by the gas, regardless of what it si pressing against. 
    * Only for constant force
