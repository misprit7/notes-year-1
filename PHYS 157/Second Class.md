# Second Class
Sep 6 2019
* How the course works
  * Pre-reading + quiz
    * On monday
  * lecture \*active\*
  * Tutorial
  * Homework (online + written)
  * All of this contributes to the midterm and final exams
* Conservation of energy: our starting point
  * First fully understood by Emmy Noether
    * 1882-1935
    * Proved Noether's Theorem that explains how conserved quantities are related to symmetries in nature
  * In practice
    * Each part of a physical system has a certain amount of energy
    * The total energy of an isolated system doesn't change with time
    * Energy can move between different parts and take different forms
* In thermodynamics we care about the microscopic kinetic and potential energy of atoms of molecules
* When we heat/cool an object, we are adding/removing energy at the molecular level
* Heating/cooling also affects macroscopic/observable properties
* Which macroscopic properties of objects change when they are heated/cooled? 
  * Size/volume/density
  * Amount of light/IR
    * Higher temperature means more radiation
  * Electrical conductivity
* Heat flow demo
* If we bring two objects in contact, there are 3 options
  * If nothing changes, the systems are in equilibrium and have the same temperature
  * If energy flows from object A to B, A is higher in temperature
  * If energy flows from object B to A, B is higher in temperature
* Zeroth law of thermodynamcs
  * If two objects are in contact with a thrid and they're all in equilibrium, the first two objects are the same temperature/are in equilibrium
  * Otherwise, temperature wouldn't make sense
* We can assign a numerical value for different temperatures by using some temperature-dependent macroscopic property of a standard object (eg. volume of liquid in a table)
