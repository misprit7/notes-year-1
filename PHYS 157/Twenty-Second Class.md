# Twenty-Second Class

* Otto Cycle: 
  * Efficiency$=1-\frac{1}{r^{\gamma-1}}$
  * Higher efficiency for larger compression ratio
  * __BUT__: gasoline will spontaneously ignite if $r$ is too large
    * "Engine knocking"
  * High octane fuel: Higher ignition temperature, so less knocking
  * Real engine $r=8$ to $10$
* Diesel engine
  * Larger compression ratio
  * Inject fuel when $T$ is very high, ignites spontaneously
  * More efficient
  * Two adiabatic prcoesses, fuel is put in during a isobaric pressure at high pressure and temperature
* Full cycles
  * $\Delta u=0$ for full cycles
  * Therefore for a full cycle, $Q=Q_H+Q_C=W$ (remember $Q_C$ is negative, so $Q_H+Q_C$ is the net heat)
  * Efficiency can also be expressed as $e=\frac{Q_{net}}{Q_H}=\frac{Q_H+Q_C}{Q_H}=1-\frac{|Q_C|}{Q_H}$
* Refrigorators: Can transfer heat from colder system to warmer system by doing work
  * Heat engine in reverse (including $PV$ diagram going backwards)
  * Process
    * Constant temperature expansion
    * Constant volume heating
    * Constant temperature compression
    * Constant volume cooling
