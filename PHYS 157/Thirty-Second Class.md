# Thirty-Second Class

* Coupled oscillators
  * Displacement of one oscillator leads to:
    * $F_1$: restoring forces on that oscillator
    * $F_2$: forces to displace the nearby oscillators
  * When one oscillator is displaced and the others are at rest, a pulse moves through the oscillators and the orginal one that was displaced gets lower amplitude
  * If energy is continually supplied to one, a wave forms
    * Called transverse
* Transverse waves
  * Oscillations perpendicular to direction wave travels
  * Actual particles aren't being displaced
* Longitudinal waves
  * Particles are oscillating parrallel to the direction the wave travels
* Many (most?) physical systems act as coupled oscillators
  * Stretched string: tensions provides restoring force for displaced section
* Mathematical description of waves
  * At each time, we have a function that describes a "snapshot" of the wave at that time
  * Define $D(x, t)$ to be the displacement at position $x$ at time $t$
* In solids, each atom is in an equilibrium position
  * Similar to a system of coupled oscillators
  * Warm solid: these oscillators have small random oscillations about equilibrium
  * Can have longitudinal vertical waves can form this way
    * e.g. Sound waves in solid
  * Can also have transverse waves in solides
    * e.g. S waves in earthquakes
