# Third Class
Sep 9, 2019
* We can assign a numerical value to temperatures by using some temperature-dependent macroscopic property of a standard
  * If a mercury thermometer is used, expansion isn't perfectly linear
  * Definitions of T can depend on materials
  * Simplest material: ideal gas
    * Molecules with negligible interaction (good approximation at low density)
    * Look at changes in pressure for fixed volume
* Pressure = force on wall per unit area
  * $P = \frac{F}{A}$
  * S.I. unit: Pascal
    * $\frac{N}{m^2}$
