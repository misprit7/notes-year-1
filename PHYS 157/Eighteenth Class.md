* Piston example
  * Gas has positive work for expansion
    * $W=P\cdot \Delta V$
    * $\Delta u=Q-W$
  * Person pulling up also has positive work
  * Energy is conserved since there's atmospheric pressure doing negative work on the piston
    * $W_{person}+W_{gas}+W_{atmosphere}=0$
* First law of thermodynamics
  * $\Delta u=Q-W$
    * $\Delta u$ is net change in energy of gas
    * $Q$ is heat added to gas
    * $W$ is work done by gas
* Internal energy
  * $\Delta u=nC_v\Delta T$
* Energy of a monatomic ideal gas: 
  * $u$ = total kinetic energy of molecules
  * $=NE_{kin}^{avg}=const.\cdot n\cdot T$
  * $u=\frac{3}{2}nRT$
  * $\Delta u=nC_v\Delta T$, so $C_v=\frac{3}{2}R$
    * $R=8.31$ J/mol K
* $W=p\cdot\Delta V$ doesn't work if a slit is removedi n a box
* $u$ is a "state vairable": determined from $P$, $V$, $T$, $n$
  * Ideal gas: $u$ determined from $T$ and $n$ only
  * __$\Delta u$ only depends on intial and final state (not on the path)__
* Different types of processes: 
  * Isochoric: $V$ constant
  * Isobaric: $P$ constant
  * Isothermal: $T$ constant
  * Adiabatic: $Q=0$
