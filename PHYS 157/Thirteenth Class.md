* Radiation from an object comes in a mix of wavelengths
  * We can desribe this by graphing the spectrum (spectrum graph)
  * Area gives the total power in the range of wavelenths
  * Lower temperature means lower total power
  * White light comes from when the spectrum graph's peak is in the visible spectrum
* Peak wavelength is inversly proportional to $T$
  * $\gamma_{max}=\frac{b}{T}$
    * Wien displacement law
    * $b=2.9$ is a constant
  * Outer space: peak at 1mm $\rightarrow$ 2.7K
    * Cosmic microwave background
  * Sun: peak at 500nm $\rightarrow$ 5700K
* Total power is proportional to $T^4$
  * $H=Ae \sigma T^4$
    * $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzemann constant, equal to $5.67\cdot 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2K^4}$
    * $e$ is emmissivity
      * More of a property of the surface, not the object itself
    * $A$ is surface area
    * $H$ is heat current
  * $e=\frac{H}{H_{\textrm{blackbody}}}$
    * $e=1$ for perfect blackbody
    * $e=0$ for a perfect mirror
