* Heat
  * $Q=$ heat (Joules)
    * Amount of energy transfered due to temperature differences
  * Heat required to raise the temperature of a material determined by its specific heat $c$: 
    * $Q=mc\triangle T$
      * $Q$ = heat added
      * $m$ = mass
      * $\triangle T$ = change in temperature
      * $c$ in $\frac{\textnormal{J}}{\textnormal{kgK}}$
      * $C$ in $\frac{\textnormal{J}}{\textnormal{mol K}}$
    * Different $c$ can be because more complicated molecules don't have all of the energy added to simple kinetic energy (eg. rotational, etc.)
