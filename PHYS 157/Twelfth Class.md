* Midterm
  * 5-6 Multiple choice
  * 2 Written Questions
* Thermal resistance: measures effectiveness of insulation layer
  * $R=\frac{L}{k}$
  * "R-value" is this quantity in units of $\textrm{ft}^2\textrm{F}\degree\cdot \frac{\textrm{hours}}{\textrm{Btu}}$
* Analogy with electrical resistance +ohm's law:
  * $I=\frac{V_2-V_1}{R_e}$ vs. $\frac{H}{A}=\frac{T_H-T_C}{R}$
  * Similar to resistors in parallel, thermal resistance adds up
* Other methdos of heat transfer:
  * Convection: heat transfer via macroscopic motion of fluids
    * Very complicated fluid dynamics to understand
  * Radiation" all objects give off electromagnetic radiation (light, IR, etc...)
    * This carries energy away from the ovject
* Electromagnetic radiation:
  * Light is an electromagnetic wave: 
    * Oscillating electric field $\Leftarrow\Rightarrow$ Oscillating magnetic field
  * Colour is determined by wavelength
    * Red has lower wavelength, violet has a higher one
  * Intensity/brightness determined by amplitude
    * Light carries energy
  * Can have electromagnetic waves at all wavelengths
* Thermal radiation from an object
  * Typically in IR/visible light
  * Can measure current at various wavelengths=spectrum
  * Higher wavelength is higher temperature
* Graphs can be used to describe the spread in wavelength
  * Power of radiation emitted at a certain range of wavelengths is the area under the power/nm vs. wavelength graph
