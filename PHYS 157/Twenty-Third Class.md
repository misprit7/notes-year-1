# Twenty-Third Class

* A flow of heat from a cold object to a hot object (without any associated work) wouldn't violate conservation of energy
  * Conservation of energy only states that energy isn't created or destroyed, in this situation it's only being transferred
* Discussion question: Why dows heat always flow from hot objects to colder objects? 
  * Molecular explanation doesn't completely explain it, since collisions between molecules could be elastic but keep a difference in energy
  * Any given distribution of energy in particles is equally likely, but there are way more possibilities in which energy is distributed relatively equally than in which there is a steep temperature drop off
  * Analogy: If you start with 100 frogs on the right side of a 2D box, if they hop randomly (completely independantly of each other) they will become evenly distributed
    * If given time, frogs will be more likely to be spread out
    * Frogs represent units of energy randomly being transferred with each collision
    * Density of frogs represent temperature
  * Because energy is exchanged between nearby molecules via random processes, heat will almost certainly flow from the higher temperature side to the lower temperature side to become more evenly distributed
* Entropy is a measure of how many possible microscopic configurations there are for a specified set of macroscopic variables
  * Entropy is $\log(N)$, where $N$ is the number of possible states
  * Second law of thermodynamics says that the total entropy of a closed system never decreases
