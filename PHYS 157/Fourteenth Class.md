* Emmisivity varies by temperature
* Net heat current from thermal radiation (in uniform temperature environment)
  * $H_{rad}=A\cdot e\cdot \sigma\cdot T^4$
  * $H_{absorbed}=A\cdot e\cdot \sigma\cdot T^4_{surroundings}$
  * Equilibrium: $H_{rad}=H_{absorbed}$
* Key relation for steady-state heat flow:
  * $H_{in}=H_{out}$
  * Steady state means temperatures not changing
    * Temperatures don't have to be the same
* Solar constant
  * The power from the sun is $H_{sun}=A_{sun}\cdot\sigma\cdot T^4_{sun}$
  * At earth's orbit, the power per unit area (or intensity) of sunlight is $I_{sc}=1367W/m^2=\frac{H_S}{4\pi R^2}$
    * Solar constant
  * Emissivity of the sun is almost exactly 1 because it's made of plasma
* Albeto vs. emmisivity
  * Emmisivity refers to all spectrums of electromagnetic radiation, while albeto's constant refers only to visible light
  * Actual surface temperature is larger on the earth than expected due to the greenhouse effect: some IR radiation is absorbed by "greenhouse gases" + re-emitted back to earth. 
    * Emmisivity goes from 1 to 0.6 from this effect
    * Globabl warming causes a further decrease in the emmisivity
