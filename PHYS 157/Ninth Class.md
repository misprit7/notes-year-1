* Specific heat
  * Temperature proportional to average kinetic energy of molecules
  * For more complicated materials, bart of added energy added goes to roation/vibrations et., so it takes more $Q$ to increase the kinetic energy
* General Formula
  * $T=\frac{m_1c_1}{m_1c_1+m_2c_2}T_1+\frac{m_2c_2}{m_1c_1+m_2c_2}T_2$
* Phases of matter
  * Significant changes in conifugration of molecules can occur as we vary $T\cdot P$
* Phase Diagram
  * Displays phases and phase transition curve as a function of $T$ and $P$
* Phase change
  * macroscopic properties change dramatically across phase boundary
  * At transition temperature, transition occurs due to heat added/removed - no temp. change!
  * Amount of heat required for transition per mass of material is latent heat
    * Latent heat of fusion, $L_f$, is freezing/metling
    * Latent heat of vaporization, $Lv$, is boiling/condensing
    * $Q=mL$
    * $L$ is in $\frac{J}{kg}$: energy required to metl/vaporize 1kg of material
    * Latent heat decreases as pressure increases
    * Also a latent heat of sublimation
