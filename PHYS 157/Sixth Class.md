* Water
  * Special example
  * Mostly linear, but some exceptions
  * Water is most dense at $4\degree$C, and volume actually goes up slightly as temperature gets smaller near $0\degree$C
  * Otherwise, lakes would completely freeze over
* Thermal expansion $\to$ forces
  * Stress & strain
    * $\frac{F}{A} = Y\frac{\triangle l}{l_0}$
      * Similar to $F = k\triangle x$ for springs
    * Tension: pulling apart
    * Compression: pushing together
    * Stress has units of pressure
* Elastic vs. plastic
  * As strain happens, there is first a linear range, but after that relationship breaks down, there is a point at which the material won't go back to its original shape
    * Before this point, it's elastic, but after it goes past the point of no return it's considered inelastic
    * Can still be elastic even a bit past the linerar range
    * When the material completely breaks, it's called the fracture point
* Thermal stress: forces ona material due to surrounding materials preventing thermal expansion/contraction $\alpha$
