* Linear expansion
  * $\triangle L=\alpha L_0 \triangle T$
  * If $r_0$ is the lowest potential energy state (relating to how far the atoms are away from each other), then more energy configurations when heated up
    * More higher energy configurations with $r>r_0$ than $r< r_0$
* Volume expansion 
  * $\triangle V = \beta V_0 \triangle T$
  * $\beta = 3\alpha$
    * Intuitive and geometric proof for this
