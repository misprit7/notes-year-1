# Twentieth Class
Oct 21, 2019
* Isochoric
  * Constant volume
  * $\frac{T_1}{T_2}=\frac{P_1}{P_2}$
* Isobaric
  * Constant pressure
  * $\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\frac{V_2}{V_1}$
  * $W=P\Delta V$
  * $Q=nC_P\Delta T$
* Isothermal
  * Constant temperature
  * $Q=W=nRT\ln(\frac{V_f}{V_i})$
* Adiabatic
  * Zero heat flow
  * $nC_V\Delta T=-W$
  * $PV^\gamma=const.$
  * $TV^{\gamma-1}=const.$
  * $\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V}$
* Adibiatic curves are always the higher curve than isothermal curveson a $PV$ graph
  * Since some of the energy that would be put into temperature "leaks" out
