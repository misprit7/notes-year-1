* Mechanical equilbrium
  * Occurs when forces (and torques) on each part of the system add to zero
  * e.g. $\vec{F}_{gas}+\vec{F}_{gravity}+\vec{F}_{air}=0$
    * Piston is in equilibrium
* Restoring forces
  * For a stable equilbrium configuration, a displacement in one direction leads to a net force in the other direction
    * e.g. springs
  * This leads to oscillations
    * Periodic motion
    * On a force vs. displacement graph, near the origin the line is linear
* Hook's law
  * Applies to almost any system perturbed a small amount from stable equilibrium
    * Not just true for springs
  * $F=-kx$
* Oscillations with Hooke's law
  * Newton: $\underbrace{a}_{\frac{dv}{dt}}=\frac{F}{m}=-\frac{k}{m}\cdot x$
  * $\frac{v(t+dt)-v(t)}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{k}{m}x$
  * $\frac{x(t+dt)-x(t)}{dt}=\frac{dx}{dt}=v$
  * This is a set of differentiable equations
  * Solution is $x(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)$
    * $\omega=\sqrt\frac{k}{m}$
* Simple harmonic motion
  * $x(t)=\underbrace{A}_{amplitude}\cos(\underbrace{\omega}_{angular frequency} t+\underbrace{\phi}_{phase})$


Next, we apply bolzano's theorem to conclude that $f^\prime(0)$
