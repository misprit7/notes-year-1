* The wave equation derivation (not required)
  * What determines $v$ and $D(x, t)$?
    * Newton's second law
  * $F_{net}=T\cdot 2\sin\theta$ in one specific part of the rope
  * $M=\mu\cdot L$ 
  * $F_{net}=T\cdot 2\sin\theta=T\cdot L\cdot \frac{d^2D}{dx^2}$
  * Since $a=\frac{F_{net}}{m}$, 
  * $\frac{d^2D}{dt^2}=\frac{T}{\mu}\frac{d^2D}{dx^2}$
    * Determines motion of wave once we specify $D(x, t=0)$ and $\frac{d}{dt}D(x, t=0)$
    * General solution is sum of $F_1(x-vt)$ for right moving waves and $F_2(x+vt)$ for left moving waves with $v=\sqrt\frac{T}{\mu}$
* Interference of waves
  * Another consequence of the superposition principle
  * Waves from 2 sources
    * Displacement at point $P$ is the sum of the displacements from the two individual waves
* Constructive interference
  * When two waves amplify each other
  * No phase difference
  * Happens when distances from the 2 sources differ by $\lambda, 2\lambda, 3\lambda, \ldots$
* Destructive interference
  * When two waves "cancel out"
  * Happens when distance from the 2 sources differ by $\frac{\lambda}{2}, \frac{3\lambda}{2}, \frac{5\lambda}{2}, \ldots$
