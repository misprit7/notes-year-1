* Thermal conductivity
  * Heat moves more quickly through some materials than others in response to a temperature gradient
  * Metal is a good thermal conductor, plastic isn't
  * Metal feels colder since i cools our skin quicker
    * Even though it could have a lower specific heat
* Quantifying thermal conductivity
  * Heat $dQ$ flows out in time $dt$
  * Heat current: energy per unit time flowing from one part of a system to another
    * $H=\frac{dQ}{dt}$
* Heat current is proportional to temperature gradient
  * $H=kA\frac{T_H-T_c}{L}$
    * $H$=Heat current
    * $k$=Thermal conductivity
    * $A$ is the cross sectional area
    * Fractional term is the temperature gradient
      * $L$ is the length
      * $T_H-T_c$ is the difference between temperatures
      * More sophisticated calculs version is $\frac{dT}{dx}$
