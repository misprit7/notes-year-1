# Fifth Class
Sep 11, 2019
* A closed interval is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ in one of the following forms: 
  * $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: x\leq a \textnormal{ and } x\leq b\}$, where $a, b\in \mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$
      * $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: a\leq x\leq b\}$
      * $[a, b]$
      * This is called a finite length closed interval. It has length $b-a$
  * $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: a\leq x\}$, where $a\in \mathbb{R}$
    * $[a, \infty)$
  * $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: x\leq b\}$, where $b\in \mathbb{R}$
    * $(-\infty , b]$
  * $\mathbb{R}$
* The empty set
  * $\{\} = \emptyset$
  * Notation: If $S$ and $T$ are sets and $S\cap T = \emptyset$, we say $S$ and $T$ are disjoint
* Open set
  * Set of open intervals
  * The idea that no matter where you are in that set, then it's possible to take a tiny step in either direction and remain in the set
* Closed set
  * If $S$ is a set and $\mathbb{R}\backslash S$ is an open set, $S$ is a closed set
* What about:
  * $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: a< x \leq b\}$
    * $(a, b]$
  * $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: a\leq x < b\}$
    * $[a, b)$
  * Both are "half open interval", or "clopen interval"
* Def: A function is a rule $f$ that assigns to each element $x$ of a set $D$, called the domain, a unique element $f(x)$ of a set $S$, called the co-domain
  * $S$ and $D$ might be the same set
* Notation: we write $x\in D$, $f(x)\in S$, and $f:D\rightarrow S$
  * Example: $D = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, S=\mathbb{R}$, and $f$ is given by $f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=\pi, f(4)=-3$
  * The above wouldn't be a function if $f(1)=1, f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=6, f(4)=11$
  * Functions don't have to output numbers
* In this class, the domain will always be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, and the domain will be $\mathbb{R}$. Thus, our functions will be of the form $f:D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 
  * e.g. $D=\mathbb{R}, f(x)=0; f(x) = 17; f(x)=x; f(x) = 2x; f(x) = x^2+x+1$ are all examples of polynomials
  * e.g. $D = \mathbb{R}, f(x) = \sin{x}; f(x)=\cos(x); f(x)=\sin(3x)$ are examples of trigonometric functions
  * e.g. $D=\mathbb{R}, f(x)=e^x; f(x) = e^{2x}$ are examples of exponential functions
  * e.g. $D = (0, \infty), f(x) = \log{x}; f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\log{(x/10)}$ are examples of logarithmic functions
  * All of the examples above are studied because they show up often in the real world
