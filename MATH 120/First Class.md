* Sets
  * A set is a collection of distinct objects called elements
    * Braces enclose the set elements
    * eg. $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$
  * Two sets are the same if they contain the same objects
    * eg. $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ is the same as $\{1, 3, 4, 2, 5\}$
  * If $S$ is defined as $\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5\}$, $S$ is the same as $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ (because we forced $S$ to be a set)
  * The cardinality of a set is the number of distinct elements in that set (can be infinite)
* Frequently used sets
  * Set of natural numbers
    * Represented by $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
    * Doesn't include 0
  * Set of integers
    * Represented by $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
  * Set of Rational numbers
    * Represented by $\mathbb{Q}$
    * 1st Def (less good): We define $\mathbb{Q}$ to be the set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form $\frac{a}{b}, a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$
      * Uses "number" in the definition, so not great
    * 2nd Def (better): We define $\mathbb{Q}$ to be the set of all pairs of integers $(a, b)$ where $a \neq 0$ and we declare that the pair $(a, b)$ is the same as $(a', b')$ if $ab' = a'b$
  * Set of all real numbers
    * Represented by $\mathbb{R}$
    * Will be talked about next class
