* Bolzano's theorem: Let $f:[a, b]\to\R$ be continuous, and suppose that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs. Then there exists $c\in(a, b)$ so that $f(c)=0$. 
  * Suppose WLOG that $f(a)<0$ and $f(b)>0$. Let $S=\{x\in[a, b]:f(x)\leq 0\}$. First, $S$ is not empty because $a\in S$ because $f(a)<0$. Second, $S$ is bounded above since $x\leq b$ for all $x\in S$. Thus, $S$ has a least upper bound (A.K.A. supremum). We call this least upper bound $c$. 
  * Either $f(c)>0, f(c)=0$, or $f(c)<0$. Suppose $f(c)>0$. By the (modified) lemma, there exists $\delta>0$ so that $f(x)>0$ for all $x\in(c-\delta, c+\delta)$. In particular, $f(x)>0$ for all $x\in[c-\frac{\delta}{2}, c]$. We will show that $c-\frac{\delta}{2}$ is an upper bound for $S$. Let $x\in S$. Since $c$ is an upper bound for $S$, we have $x\leq c$. Next, since $f(x)>0$ for all $x\in[c-\frac{\delta}{2}, c]$, if $x\in S$, we have that $c\notin[c-\frac{\delta}{2}, c]$. Hence, if $x\in S$, $x\leq c-\frac{\delta}{2}$, so $c-\frac{\delta}{2}$ is an upper bound for $S$ But this contradicts the fact that $c$ is the least upper bound. 
  * Next, suppose $f(c)<0$. By the (modified) lemma, there exists $\delta>0$ so that $f(x)<0$ for all $x\in(c-\delta, c+\delta)$. In particular, $f(c+\delta/2)<0$, so $c+\frac{\delta}{2}\in S$. But this contradicts the fact that $c$ is an upper bound for $S$.
